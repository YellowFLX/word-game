# The analogue of the "WORDLE" in Russian

- Go play the real Wordle [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)
- Try my version [here](https://ruword-game.herokuapp.com) (_it may take 1-2 minutes to start_)
---
The challenge is to guess the word in 7 tries:
- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.
- After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
- Green tile - The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
- Yellow tile - The letter I is in the word but in the wrong spot.
